# Twelve Tone Row Generator

## What is Twelve-Tone Row?

In the 1920â€™s, Arnold Schoenberg created the twelve-tone compositional technique which is based on rows (or series) that contain all twelve pitches in a specific order. It is designed to ensure that every pitch class is used at the same frequency as other pitch classes. For each piece, composers write a unique row.

There are a few rules for using a twelve-tone row:
* Pitch classes are played in order
* Once a pitch class has been played, it is not repeated

### Forms

The twelve-tone row can be used as a theme in a music piece. The basic ordering, is known as the prime form (P). Rows can be transposed, inverted, or retrograded to create new tone rows. Inverting the prime form creates the "I-form." Playing the prime form backwards is called retrograde, also known as "R-form." When an inverted form is retrograded, it is known as a "RI-form."

## Magic Square/Matrix

The magic square was invented by Milton Babbitt in the 1950's. It offers the twelve transposition of the four transformations (prime, inversion, retrograde, and retrograde inversion) in a 12*12 matrix. The rows of the square read from left to right represent the prime form and read from right to left represent the retrograded form. The columns of the square read up to down represent the inverted form and read down to up represent the retrograde inverted form.

## Twelve-Tone Row Generator

This is a program that generates a random twelve-tone row and then completes the Babbitt square.
